# mavilam site
Hey, welcome to my personal site.
## Reason of the last redevelopment
Lately, all websites are sites built with cutting-edge frameworks, and a lot of them are heavyweight. I wanted to build my site to be concise and to be light, so I visited multiple sites to be inspired (and to steal ideas and code, I'm not a frontend developer) and only to use HTML and CSS.
