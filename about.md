<h2>Hey there, this is Miguel! 👋</h2>

I'm a proactive person with passion and vocation for tech stuff, particularly for software 👨‍💻, 3D printing and a little bit in raspberry/arduino stuff.
I studied a telematics dregree and a business master as a complement for my technical background.

During my experience as a backend engineer, I've been working with many languages but mainly with Java, Node.js, Python and Scala.
Currently working, improving and learning in the innovation and big data team of Evo Bank.
