I'm a proactive, passionate and curious software developer in love with music, [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90940182-miguel-vila), [movies](https://letterboxd.com/mavilam/), [3D printing and design](https://www.thingiverse.com/mavilam/designs) and many other things that don't let me sleep.

You can read about my side projects [here](/sideprojects/) (Should I write about more about the incomplete? 🤔).

Also, every now and then, I write a <b>[newsletter](/newsletter/)</b> 📨 (written in Spanish) that you can check it out and subscribe.
