Hey everyone! I'd like to introduce my telegram bot ðŸ¤– with a few words.

<span style=" font-weight: bold">[(@What_to_read_bot)](http://telegram.me/what_to_read_bot)</span> What to read is a simple bot that recommends you whenever you want the most sold books of "Amazon" ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and "La casa del libro" (LCDL) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ at the momment when you request it.

For now there are  the two big types of categories for each library: fiction and non fiction.

Here is a pic of the interface:

 <p/>

Pressing each button, the bot will send you the top 3 in case of "Amazon" and the top 5 in case of "La casa del libro".  

It is still in beta version so if you find any issue or you want to recommend me something to improve don't doubt: text me!
